### 14th September 2024

## Prelimary Meeting on research project ideas
*Present: Anna and Chrisanna*
Discussed paper [Machine Reading, Fast and Slow: When Do Models “Understand” Language?](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.8/), and [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Diagnosing Syntactic Heuristics in Natural Language Inference](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1334/)
__Idea 1:__ 
- Repeat work from the first paper with a generative model ([OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo)? open-source, code and training data avaliable) instead.
- Different reasoning type?
- Different interpretability type?

__Idea 2:__
- Look at training data for a model and try to replicate HANS work.
- Look for patterns in data that might suggest tasks that the model would struggle with.
- Data is very messy!! Pulled from several datasets, synthetic data, chatgpt annotation.
