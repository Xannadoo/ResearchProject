Cool Hand Luke is a 1967 American prison drama film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, starring Paul Newman and featuring George Kennedy in an Oscar- winning performance. Newman stars in the title role as Luke, a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system. The film, set in the early 1950s, is based on Donn Pearce's 1965 novel of the same name. Pearce sold the story to Warner Bros., who then hired him to write the script.

The first\" Superman\" cartoon produced by Famous Studios( the successor to Fleischer Studios),\" Japoteurs\" covers Superman's adventures stopping Japanese spies from hijacking a bomber plane and bringing it to Tokyo.

Mathe was initially arrested on 51 counts of murder, attempted murder, rape, hijacking and armed robbery in November 2006. Whilst being detained in the A6 ward of C- Max Penitentiary which houses dangerous and hardened criminals, Mathe managed to escape by smearing himself with petroleum jelly and sliding out of his cell window, which measured only 20 cm x 60 cm. This daring escape led the South African press to dub him' Houdini'. Mathe had escaped from police custody before, in April 2005. His last escape prompted a nationwide manhunt, the events of which were closely monitored by local media. He was re-arrested on 4 December 2006( about two weeks after his escape), when he hijacked a car in the affluent Johannesburg suburb of Craighall.

After earning her teaching credentials in Belgium and France, Rennotte taught for three years in Germany before moving to Brazil as a governess. Giving private lessons and teaching at a girls' school, she lived in Rio de Janeiro from 1878 to 1882. Hired to teach in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, she moved to Piracicaba where from 1882 to 1889 she taught science, developed the curriculum, and enhanced the reputation of the\" Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano\". The school was an innovative institution which promoted girls' education as equal to that of boys, offering co-educational instruction. In 1889, Rennotte, on a scholarship provided by the state, enrolled in medical school at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. That year, she was granted citizenship when a legal change allowed all foreigners permanently living in Brazil to become naturalized. Graduating in 1892, she studied at the Paris H\u00f4tel- Dieu Hospital between 1893 and 1895, completing a specialization in obstetrics and gynaecology. Upon her return to Brazil, she defended her thesis to a jury from the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Rio de Janeiro, validating her degree and allowing her to practice medicine in the country.

She continued to practice medicine through the mid-1920s, but increasingly in the 1920s and 1930s became more involved in the international feminist movement and scientific conferences. In 1922, she founded the\" Alian\u00e7a Paulista pelo Sufr\u00e1gio Feminino\"( Paulistan Alliance for Women's Suffrage). By the late 1930s, suffering from ill health, blindness and deafness, she was granted a state pension, which she collected until her death in 1942. She is remembered for her work to improve women's educational opportunities, and women's rights to better employment, health and citizenship.

Context: The Mountain Eagle is a 1926 British silent film, and Alfred Hitchcock's second as director, following\" The Pleasure Garden\". The film, a romantic melodrama set in Kentucky, is about a widower( Bernhard Goetzke) who jealously competes with his crippled son( John F. Hamilton) and a man he loathes( Malcolm Keen) over the affections of a schoolteacher( Nita Naldi). The film was mostly produced at the Emelka Film studios in Munich, Germany in autumn of 1925, with exterior scenes shot in the village of Obergurgl in the State of Tyrol, Austria. Production was plagued with problems, including the destruction of a village roof and Hitchcock experiencing altitude sickness. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and he was influenced by German cinematic style and technique. The film was screened for the producers in October 1926 who did not approve of it, and it was not until after the success of Hitchcock's that the film was released in May 1927. The film was poorly received and criticised for its lack of realism, and Hitchcock himself was relieved that the film was lost.

Context: Odinigwe Benedict Chukwukadibia Enwonwu MBE( 14 July 1917 \u2013 5 February 1994), better known as Ben Enwonwu, was a Nigerian painter and sculptor. Arguably the most influential African artist of the 20th century, his pioneering career opened the way for the postcolonial proliferation and increased visibility of modern African art. He was one of the first African artists to win critical acclaim, having exhibited in august exhibition spaces in Europe and the United States and listed in international directories of contemporary art. Since 1950, Enwonwu was celebrated as\" Africa's Greatest Artist\" by the international media and his fame was used to enlist support for Black Nationalists movement all over the world. The Enwonwu crater on the planet Mercury is named in his honour. Hezekiah Niles( October 10, 1777 \u2013 April 2, 1839), was an American editor and publisher of the Baltimore- based national weekly news magazine,\" Niles' Weekly Register\"( aka\" Niles' Register\") and the\" Weekly Register\". Niles was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania, to a Quaker family, although his father quit the church to fight in the American Revolutionary War. In 1777, the family fled from Wilmington, Delaware, ahead of the British army to the home of James Jefferis on the east side of the Brandywine Creek near Jefferis' Ford. Niles later asserted in the\" Weekly Register\" that a Hessian mercenary threatened to bayonet his mother while pregnant with him. The family returned to Wilmington and after the war his father rejoined the Quakers. At 17, Niles apprenticed with a Philadelphia printer for three years. He then worked in Wilmington for several years, attempting to establish a printing business that went bankrupt in 1801. In 1805 he published a short- lived literary magazine called the\" Apollo\". Later in 1805, he moved to Baltimore, where until 1811 he edited a daily broadsheet, the\" Baltimore Evening Post\", associated with the Democratic- Republican Party. In 1811, he issued the prospectus for the\" Weekly Register\" and had 1,500 subscribers before the first issue had been published. Niles edited and published the\" Weekly Register\" until 1836, making it into one of the most widely circulated magazines in the United States and himself into one of the most influential journalists of his day. The\" Niles' Weekly Register\" covered not only politics, but economics, science, technology, art, and literature. In the Register's discourse of politics, Niles used what he called\" magnanimous disputation\", trying to present the arguments of both sides fairly and objectively, a policy which has made the paper an important source for the history of the period.

The museum was founded in 2005 and has an exhibition space of 3,500 m, largely devoted to its permanent collection of some thousand works by international artists.

She was one of the three DHKP -C members allegedly involved in the assassination of a Turkish businessman, \u00d6zdemir Sabanc\u0131 and two of his employees on 9 January 1996 in Istanbul, Turkey. In 2008, however, she was acquitted of this charge. In 2017 she had been found guilty of involvement in the same murders in Turkey by a Belgian court. In 1999, she was captured in Belgium. At the time of her arrest, she held a fake passport under the name Nese Yildirim. Belgian officials were able to identify her only after her fingerprints were taken. In 2006, a couple of hours before her sentence was announced and in spite of being under 24- hour surveillance of the Belgian Secret Service, she managed to flee. She was to be sentenced to a four- year imprisonment in Belgium for the crimes she had committed in that country. She would later be handed over to Turkey in order to be tried for her involvement in terrorist activities within the borders of the Turkish Republic. After her escape, Interpol issued a red bulletin for Fehriye Erdal sending a message to its 186 member countries that she is to be captured and returned to Belgium. Although there have been reports that she has been seen in Cyprus and Jordan, there was no solid information on her whereabouts. In 2008, the Belgian court of appeal acquitted Fehriye Erdal of all charges against her. The court ruled there is no evidence connecting Erdal with terrorist activities.

In 2008, however, she was acquitted of this charge. In 2017 she had been found guilty of involvement in the same murders in Turkey by a Belgian court. In 1999, she was captured in Belgium. At the time of her arrest, she held a fake passport under the name Nese Yildirim. Belgian officials were able to identify her only after her fingerprints were taken. In 2006, a couple of hours before her sentence was announced and in spite of being under 24- hour surveillance of the Belgian Secret Service, she managed to flee. She was to be sentenced to a four- year imprisonment in Belgium for the crimes she had committed in that country. She would later be handed over to Turkey in order to be tried for her involvement in terrorist activities within the borders of the Turkish Republic. After her escape, Interpol issued a red bulletin for Fehriye Erdal sending a message to its 186 member countries that she is to be captured and returned to Belgium. Although there have been reports that she has been seen in Cyprus and Jordan, there was no solid information on her whereabouts. In 2008, the Belgian court of appeal acquitted Fehriye Erdal of all charges against her. The court ruled there is no evidence connecting Erdal with terrorist activities. In 2011, Belgian investigators claimed they were no longer actively looking for Erdal, who was still on Interpol's list, and they believed she might be dead.

Context: Joseph Dudley (September 23, 1647 \u2013 April 2, 1720) was a colonial administrator, a native of Roxbury in Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the son of one of its founders. He had a leading role in the administration of the Dominion of New England (1686\u20131689) which was overthrown in the 1689 Boston revolt. He served briefly on the council of the Province of New York where he oversaw the trial which convicted Jacob Leisler, the ringleader of Leisler's Rebellion. He then spent eight years in England in the 1690s as Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight, including one year as a Member of Parliament for Newtown (Isle of Wight). In 1702, he returned to New England after being appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and Province of New Hampshire, posts that he held until 1715. His rule of Massachusetts was characterized by hostility and tension, with political enemies opposing his attempts to gain a regular salary and regularly making complaints about his official and private actions. Most of his tenure was dominated by the French and Indian Wars, in which the two provinces were on the front lines with New France and suffered from a series of major and minor French and Indian raids. He orchestrated an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707, raised provincial militia forces for its successful capture in 1710, and directed an unsuccessful expedition against Quebec in 1711. Dudley's governorship initiated a hostility in Massachusetts toward royal governance, most frequently over the issue of the salaries of crown officials. The colonial legislature routinely challenged or disputed the prerogatives of the governor, and this hostility affected most of the governors of Massachusetts up to the American Revolutionary War and the end of British rule. Dudley's rule of New Hampshire, however, was comparatively uncontroversial. Francisco Jos\u00e9 Herrera Luque( Caracas, 14 December 1927 \u2013 Caracas, 15 April, 1991) was a Venezuelan writer, psychiatrist and diplomat. He is the author of several well- known historical novels, including:\" Boves, el Urogallo\"( 1972),\" Los Amos del Valle\"( 1979) and\" La Luna de Fausto\"( 1983). He was the son of Francisco Herrera Guerrero and Mar\u00eda Luisa Luque Carvallo. In 1956, he married to Maria Margarita Ter\u00e1n Austria, with whom he had five children. Herrera Luque studied in the Central University of Venezuela( UCV) and later at the University of Salamanca( 1952), where he obtained his title of physician. In Madrid he specialized in psychiatry, a field on which he wrote several scientific papers. His PhD thesis served as basis for his book:\" Los Viajeros de Indias\"( 1961), about the psychopathic loads left on the Venezuelan population by the Spanish conquistadors. His interest in understanding the origins of the personalities of Latin America people took him to the study of heritage and genetics. Herrera Luque founded the department of psychiatry of the UCV, becoming full professor. He was appointed ambassador of Venezuela in Mexico in the mid-1970s. As writer and novelist, his historical work is based on accurate and documented research. His late books:\" Los Cuatro reyes de la barajaBol\u00edvar en vivo1998\" and\" El Vuelo del Alcatraz\", were published posthumously. During the final years of his life and after his death his works gained great popularity, making him one of the best- selling writers of Venezuela. His success resulted from the combination of typical Venezuelan stories with historical facts; in his works, Herrera Luque looked beyond the official history of the country and created a parallel narrative to it. Francisco Herrera Luque died in Caracas from a heart attack on 15 April 1991. In 1992 the Francisco Herrera Luque Foundation was created.

She is the second woman to have been hanged in South Africa. Daisy De Melker was accused of three murders but was only convicted of one, that of killing her son. The charges of poisoning her husbands were never proven in a court of law. It was William Sproat, the younger brother of her second husband, who accused her because he wanted Robert Sproat's will in favour of Daisy declared invalid. Daisy refused to refund an alleged loan from Mrs. Jane Sproat, Robert's mother, to Robert; she regarded it as a gift and argued that it was not stipulated in the will as a loan. William Sproat won the civil case regarding the will, which ran concurrently with the murder trial, and was awarded costs. Daisy withdrew on the date Justice Greenberg sentenced her for murder. William's was a Pyrrhic victory however. To pay her exorbitant legal costs, Daisy had to sell off all her assets. She was declared insolvent and was eventually buried in a prison pauper's grave.

Burroughs later stated that\" Brion Gysin was the only man I ever respected.\" Adolf Fischhof (Hungarian: Fischhof Adolf) (8 December 1816 \u2013 23 March 1893) was a Hungarian-Austrian writer and politician of Jewish descent. After studying medicine (1836\u20131844) he was appointed physician at the Vienna hospital. Fischhof was one of the leaders in the revolutionary movement of 1848, commanding the students' legion of Vienna and presiding over the Committee of Public Security. He was especially prominent in the Constitutional Assembly (\"Reichstag\"), in which he represented one of the Vienna districts. In the Liberal cabinet of Doblhoff he was attached as counselor to the Ministry of the Interior. After the dissolution of the Kremsier Parliament on 7 March 1849, Fischhof was arrested, accused of rebellion and high treason, but was acquitted after an imprisonment of 9 months. He devoted himself to the practise of medicine until about 1875, when failing health compelled him to retire. With Joseph Unger, later a member of the Austrian cabinet, he published in 1861 a pamphlet entitled L\u00f6sung der Ungarischen Frage, in which he called for the division of the empire into Austria and Hungary. After the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 Fischhof wrote Ein Blick auf Oesterreich's Lage, and strongly advised an alliance with Germany. In his Oesterreich und die B\u00fcrgschaften Seines Bestandes, 1869, he recommended an autonomous constitution for Austria. In his publications Fischhof strongly advocated a federal organization of the Austrian Empire and a high degree of autonomy for national minorities. His views contrasted with the centralistic outlook of the German Liberal cabinet that was appointed by Emperor Francis-Joseph in 1867. The German liberals believed that centralism would guarantee a German majority and safeguard the liberal reforms that were introduced by this cabinet. Fischhof, however, stated that true liberalism would guarantee not just individual liberties for Austrian citizens but also national liberties for Austria's national minorities. He was convinced that only federalism could prevent a break-up of the Habsburg Monarchy along national lines. This, he believed, would ultimately lead to German or Russian domination over the small nationalities in Central Europe and end the relative freedom they enjoyed under Habsburg rule. History was to prove him right. After the collapse of German Liberalism in 1879 and the coming to power of a clerical-conservative government that could count on Slav support, Fischhof, in the conjunction with Ernst Baron Walterskirchen, planned in 1882 the foundation of a German-Austrian people's party. This party should act as a mediator in the question of nationalities and unite all liberal elements of the empire; but his efforts were frustrated by the resistance of the mainstream German Liberal constitutional party. The views of Fischhof not only differed from those of the majority of German-Liberals, but also from those of the Jewish bourgeoisie that, just as Fischhof, identified strongly with the principles of liberalism. Unlike Fischhof most middle class Jews supported mainstream German-Liberalism well into the 1880s, when it had long proven to be unable to stop the radicalization of Austrian politics and the growing anti-semitism that was part of this.

The Lacy Dog or Blue Lacy Dog is a breed of working dog that originated in Texas in the mid-19th century.  The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate.  In Senate Resolution No. 436, the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as \"a true Texas breed\".  In June 2005, Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Blue Lacy as \"the official State Dog Breed of Texas\".  As expected, the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas.  However, as the breed becomes more well recognized, there are breeding populations being established across the United States, Canada, and most recently in Europe.

Polley (January 29, 1947 \u2013 July 4, 2012) was a political campaigner, singer, animator and alleged psychic who resided in Bismarck, North Dakota. He was married to Linda Polley, who shares his political and religious views. Polley grew up in Maine before moving to North Dakota in 1999. He founded the religion of Spiritism, which according to him and his wife is based on a faith that originated 500,000 years ago on a planet named Hades and was brought to Earth by extraterrestrial colonizers, who died in a cataclysmic event remembered in human legend as the Great Flood. The Polleys claimed to be in contact with God, Jesus and Muhammad, along with the spirits of such well-known figures as John Lennon, Princess Diana, Patrick Troughton and Bach. Gerald and Linda Polley created a body of work including songs, drawings and short animations, some of which they claimed was made while channelling the spirits of dead artists. Some of this work is political in nature: \"Hussein's Butt Song\", allegedly written by the spirit of John Lennon about Saddam Hussein, has lyrics such as \"we kicked his butt before and we kicked his butt again , we got him in the heine, he knew he could not win\". Another song, attacking Hillary Clinton and cross-dressing, contains the lyrics \"if you want your sons wearing skirts and panty hose, with lipstick on their faces and shiny nail polish that glows, then vote for Hillary\". Music professor Michael Harrington studied the songs allegedly written by Lennon's spirit and, while declining to comment on the Polleys' claims that the pieces were received from the afterlife, concluded that the songs showed melodic similarities to Lennon's work. Joel Bjorling, a specialist in alternative religions, examined three of the Polleys' songs and concluded that one (\"Don't Make Heaven Mad\") resembled Lennon's songs while the other two resembled American folk songs almost note-for-note. In addition, one commentator has pointed to similarities between \"Hussein's Butt Song\" and the folk song \"Knees Up Mother Brown\". In the run-up to the 2000 presidential election, Gerald Polley claimed that Jesus had left Heaven because Bill Clinton was not impeached, and would only return should George W. Bush win the election. In 2007, Polley decided to try to run as a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 elections, taking pro-choice and anti-homosexual stances and calling for tougher laws against hiring illegal immigrants. North Dakota Republican Party Chairman Gary Emineth commented in 2007 that he was unsure that Polley was a suitable candidate. According to the Polleys' website, Gerald Polley's presidential campaign ended on 1 October 2008; the following year he announced his plans to attempt another bid for president in 2012.

He was one of Italy's leading authorities on the law of civil procedure. After studies in Pisa and Rome, Calamandrei assumed a professorship at the law school at the University of Messina in 1915. He fought as a volunteer in the 218th infantry regiment in World War I, rising to the rank of captain, and turning down a further promotion to resume teaching. In 1918, he resumed teaching at the University of Modena, then went on to teach at the law school in Siena, and finally, in Florence. His notable works include \"La cassazione civile\" (Appellate Review of Civil Judgments) (1920) and \"Studi sul processo civile\" (1930). He also co-founded the journals \"Rivista di diritto processuale\" (1924), \" Il foro toscano\" (The Tuscan Courts) (1926) and \"Il Ponte\" (The Bridge) (1945), and participated in the 1942 revision of the Italian code of civil procedure. Calamandrei was highly critical of Italian fascism; he signed, for instance, Benedetto Croce's 1925 Manifesto of Anti-Fascist Intellectuals and was linked to the Florentine journal \"Non mollare!\" (Don't Give Up!) published between January and October 1925. After the fall of the fascist regime in 1943, the Allies named him rector of the University of Florence. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1945 and, as a Social Democrat, to the National Assembly in 1948.

Petko was born in the Bulgarian village of Dogan Hisar, today Aisymi( Evros regional unit, Greece). He married a Greek lady from Maronia in 1860. When a group of Turkish brigands attacked his wife, he fought and killed them all, including the leader of the bashibuzuks, Mehmed Kesedji Bey. Beginning in 1861 Petko began fighting against the Ottomans in the surrounding areas of Maroneia, Aisymi, Enos etc. He visited Italy in 1866, where he met Giuseppe Garibaldi, who became a close friend. Petko lived in Garibaldi's home for a few months. Garibaldi helped Petko organize the well- known\" Garibaldi Battalion\" in the Cretan Revolution of 1866 \u2013 1869, consisting of 220 Italians and 67 Bulgarians, who fought the Ottomans on Crete under Petko's command. For his service, Petko was assigned the military title of\" Kapetan\"( Captain). Petko Voyvoda's detachment, established in 1869, took part in the Russo- Turkish War of 1877- 78. His unit liberated Maroneia from the Turkish rule in December 1877, establishing a Christian government there. He fought against the Turks for three months and saved the local population from Turkish oppression. After that, he took part in the liberation of the Rhodopes together with Kraycho Voyvoda. As part of this effort, he led the defeat of the 1878 Muslim insurgence in the Rhodopes organized by the British agent Saint Clair. With his son and new wife Rada Kravkova from Kazanlak Petko lived in Varna after 1880 and died in that city in 1900. He founded the revolutionary committee called\" Strandzha\" there in 1896. His revolutionary work has been commemorated with numerous monuments all around Bulgaria, as well as in his native village in modern Greece and on the hill of Gianicolo in Rome, where a monument of Garibaldi also stands. The TV series\" Captain Petko Voivode\" written by Nikolay Haytov and first aired in 1981 also popularized him as a national hero.

If she does n't succeed, she will lose her only source of food and shelter; but if she resists, she and her helpless blind sibling will be killed. And if the mysterious intruder dressed like a soldier who claims he can help them turns out to be a liar, then the enemy may already be in the house.

After his death, Jehovah's Witnesses and numerous independent Bible Student groups developed from this base. In July 1879, Russell began publishing a monthly religious journal,\" Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence\". In 1881 he co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society with William Henry Conley as president; in 1884 the corporation was officially registered, with Russell as president. Russell wrote many articles, books, tracts, pamphlets and sermons, totaling approximately 50,000 printed pages. From 1886 to 1904, he published a six- volume Bible study series originally titled\" Millennial Dawn\", later renamed\" Studies in the Scriptures\", nearly 20 million copies of which were printed and distributed around the world in several languages during his lifetime.

Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career.

Born in Birmingham, England, his mother converted to Mormonism and immigrated to the United States with her children; they settled at Salt Lake City, Utah in 1864. Upon arriving in Utah Territory and facing evidence that Mormon men were practicing polygamy, Mantle's mother came to believe that she had been deceived by the Mormon missionaries and she and her children renounced the LDS Church. Mantle attended a village school and moved to Idaho Territory in 1870, where he was a telegraph operator and stage agent. He moved to Butte, Montana in 1877 and became agent of the Wells- Fargo Express Co. He established the Inter Mountain, a daily Republican newspaper, in 1881 and served as alderman the same year. He was a member of the Territorial house of representatives in 1882, 1884, and 1888, and served as speaker in 1888; he was mayor of Butte in 1892 and many times chairman of local and State conventions.

Born in Birmingham, England, his mother converted to Mormonism and immigrated to the United States with her children; they settled at Salt Lake City, Utah in 1864. Upon arriving in Utah Territory and facing evidence that Mormon men were practicing polygamy, Mantle's mother came to believe that she had been deceived by the Mormon missionaries and she and her children renounced the LDS Church. Mantle attended a village school and moved to Idaho Territory in 1870, where he was a telegraph operator and stage agent. He moved to Butte, Montana in 1877 and became agent of the Wells- Fargo Express Co. He established the Inter Mountain, a daily Republican newspaper, in 1881 and served as alderman the same year. He was a member of the Territorial house of representatives in 1882, 1884, and 1888, and served as speaker in 1888; he was mayor of Butte in 1892 and many times chairman of local and State conventions. Lee Mantle was appointed to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy in the term commencing March 4, 1893, caused by the failure of the legislature to elect, but was not seated; he was then elected as a Republican to fill the vacancy and served from January 16, 1895 to March 3, 1899. In 1896, he switched parties and joined the Silver Republican Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1899, and organized and became chairman of the Silver Republican Party of Montana in 1896, but returned to the Republican Party in 1900. He was manager and part- time editor of the Inter Mountain until 1901 and also engaged in the real estate and mining business. In 1921, he moved to Los Angeles, California and died there in 1934; he was interred in Mount Moriah Cemetery, Butte. Question: Who was born later, Silas Hardy or Lee Mantle?

It is the successor corporation to Colt's earlier firearms- making efforts, which started in 1836. Colt is known for the engineering, production, and marketing of firearms, most especially between the 1850s and World War I, when it was a dominating force in its industry and a seminal influence on manufacturing technology. Colt's earliest designs played a major role in the popularization of the revolver and the shift away from earlier single- shot pistols. Although Samuel Colt did not invent the revolver concept, his designs resulted in the first very successful ones. The most famous Colt products include the Colt Walker, made 1847 in the facilities of Eli Whitney Jr., the Single Action Army or Peacemaker, the Colt Python, and the Colt M1911 pistol, which is currently the longest- standing military and law enforcement service handgun in the world and is still used today. Though they did not develop it, for a long time Colt was also primarily responsible for all AR- 15 and M16 rifle production, as well as many derivatives of those firearms. The most successful and famous of these are numerous M16 carbines, including the Colt Commando family, and the M4 carbine. In 2002, Colt Defense was split off from Colt'S Manufacturing Company.

Context: Blue Is the Warmest Colour  is a 2013 French romance film co-written, co-produced, and directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, and starring L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos. The film follows Ad\u00e8le (Exarchopoulos), a French teenager who discovers desire and freedom as an aspiring female painter (Seydoux) enters her life. The film charts their relationship from Adele's high school years to her early adult life and career as a school teacher. The premise of \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" is based on the 2010 graphic novel of the same name by Julie Maroh. Production began in March 2012 and lasted six months. Approximately 800 hours of footage was shot, including extensive B-roll footage, with Kechiche ultimately trimming the final cut of the film down to 179 minutes. The film generated controversy upon its premiere at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and before its release. Much of the controversy was about claims of poor working conditions on set by the crew and the lead actresses, and also the film's raw depiction of sexuality. At the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, the film unanimously won the Palme d'Or from the official jury and the FIPRESCI Prize. It is the first film to have the Palme d'Or awarded to both the director and the lead actresses, with Seydoux and Exarchopoulos joining Jane Campion (\"The Piano\") as the only women to have won the award. The film had its North American premiere at the 2013 Telluride Film Festival. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.

Tender Mercies is a 1983 American drama film directed by Bruce Beresford. The screenplay by Horton Foote focuses on Mac Sledge, a recovering alcoholic country music singer who seeks to turn his life around through his relationship with a young widow and her son in rural Texas. Robert Duvall plays the role of Mac; the supporting cast includes Tess Harper, Betty Buckley, Wilford Brimley, Ellen Barkin and Allan Hubbard. Financed by EMI Films,\" Tender Mercies\" was shot largely in Waxahachie, Texas. The script was rejected by several American directors before the Australian Beresford accepted it. Duvall, who sang his own songs in the film, drove more than throughout the state, tape recording local accents and playing in country music bands to prepare for the role. He and Beresford repeatedly clashed during production, at one point prompting the director to walk off the set and reportedly consider quitting the film. The film encompasses several different themes, including the importance of love and family, the possibility of spiritual resurrection amid death, and the concept of redemption through Mac Sledge's conversion to Christianity. Following poor test screening results, distributor Universal Pictures made little effort to publicize\" Tender Mercies\", which Duvall attributed to the studio's lack of understanding of country music. The film was released on March 4, 1983, in a limited number of theaters.

John Keith Vaughan( 23 August 1912 \u2013 4 November 1977), generally known as Keith Vaughan, was a British painter. Born in Selsey, Vaughan attended Christ's Hospital school. He worked in an advertising agency until the war, when as an intending conscientious objector he joined the St John Ambulance; in 1941 he was conscripted into the Non-Combatant Corps. Vaughan was self- taught as an artist. His first exhibitions took place during the war. In 1942 he was stationed at Ashton Gifford near Codford in Wiltshire, and paintings from this time include\" The Wall at Ashton Gifford\"( Manchester Art Gallery). Also during the war Vaughan formed friendships with the painters Graham Sutherland and John Minton, with whom after demobilization in 1946 he shared premises. Through these contacts he formed part of the neo-romantic circle of the immediate post -war period. However, Vaughan rapidly developed an idiosyncratic style which moved him away from the Neo- Romantics. Concentrating on studies of male figures, his works became increasingly abstract. Vaughan worked as an art teacher at the Camberwell College of Arts, the Central School of Art and later at the Slade School.

He grew up in Preu\u00dfisch Oldendorf, the son of Julius Lowenstein, a merchant, and Henriette Grunewald, into a Jewish family, and, when he was 19, began to study mathematics and philosophy at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, before switching to medicine in another university. In 1914 he received his medical degree from the University of Bonn, and following service as a military physician during World War I, he returned to Bonn as a neuropsychiatric assistant to Alexander Westphal. While at Bonn, he was involved in the fields of pediatric psychiatry and experimental psychology. He became Chief of Staff at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital of Bonn University (1920\u20131926). He became Chief Neuropsychiatrist and Director of the State Hospital for Nervous and Mental Diseases and founded the pioneering Neuropsychiatric Hospital for children, serving as its head from 1926 to 1933. This hospital continues to operate to this day and is believed to be the first specialized hospital of its kind in the world. He was the Director of the Institute for Heredity in Neurology and Psychiatry, (Institut Fuer Neurologisch\u2013Psychiatrische Erbforschung) from 1926 to 1933. Together with his wife, Dr Marta (Grunewald ) Lowenstein, he conducted hundreds of interviews to develop family histories of neurological illnesses. While in Germany he also began early research into pupillography as a means to detect and diagnose mental and neurological disorders including engineering the first machines and methodologies to assist in the study of the eye as a window to the brain. In 1933, because of his Jewish ethnicity, he relocated to Switzerland in order to escape Nazi persecution, working as a neuropsychiatrist at the \"Clinique La M\u00e9tairie\" in Nyon. He was a member of the faculty of the University of Geneva, Department of Ophthalmology, and Director of the Pupillographic Laboratory from 1935 to 1939. Under his leadership, the laboratory and the equipment pioneered there were invented and used in his researching the pupil. In 1939 he emigrated to New York City, where he was associated with New York University and later Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. In New York, he continued neuro-ophthalmological research with his research assistant Irene Loewenfeld. As he was preparing final edits to a major compendium of his life work specializing on the pupil, he was taken ill with pancreatic cancer. His work was entrusted to Dr Loewenfeld who had received her Ph.D. From the University of Bonn under Dr Lowenstein's mentorship. The work was ultimately published in the 1990s. He is remembered for his studies involving motion, size and functionality of the eye's pupil from a neuropsychiatric standpoint. In Germany and America, he created laboratories containing specialized equipment for research of the eye's pupil. He was particularly interested in the status of an individuals' pupil during specific emotional and psychological states, as well as the condition of the pupil during periods of fatigue and alertness. In 1957, with Irene Loewenfeld, he built an \"electronic pupillograph\" that incorporated infrared technology. This device was used to accurately measure and analyze the pupils' diameter, and was a forerunner to more sophisticated pupillographic instruments that were developed in later years.

Plancius fled from Brussels to Amsterdam to avoid religious prosecution by the Inquisition after the city fell into Spanish hands in 1585.

Context: Daniel Agnew was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from 1873 to 1879. Agnew was born at Trenton, New Jersey on January 5, 1809, and was of Irish/ Welsh heritage. His father was a Princeton- educated doctor; his mother was part of the Howell family that was prominent in New Jersey affairs of that era. The family moved to Pittsburgh, when Agnew was about four years old. Agnew grew up there, attended the Western University of Pennsylvania( now the University of Pittsburgh), and then studied law with two experienced attorneys. He was admitted to the bar in 1829, at age 20 and began practicing law. He soon relocated his legal practice about 35 miles north, to the town of Beaver, Pennsylvania, the county seat of Beaver County. He became an expert on land titles, an important topic in western Pennsylvania at that time. In his retirement he used this expertise to write a book on the subject, published in 1887 and entitled:\" A History of the Region of Pennsylvania North of the Ohio and West of the Allegheny River, of the Indian Purchases, and the Running of the Southern, Northern and Western Boundaries\". In 1831, he married Elizabeth Moore, daughter of Robert Moore, a prominent citizen and politician in Beaver. In 1836, he was chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of Pennsylvania. In 1851, he was appointed to fill a vacancy as President Judge of a four- county district. Within a few months, he was elected to a full ten- year term for that position; in 1861, he was elected to a second ten- year term. In 1863, he attracted statewide attention for a speech that he gave with the title\" Our National Constitution: Its Adaptation to a State of War or Insurrection\". Subsequently, he was nominated in 1864 to run for a seat as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Running on a Republican ticket that also included the popular Republican governor Andrew Curtin, Agnew defeated the incumbent, then- Chief Justice Walter H. Lowrie. In 1873, he became the Chief Justice. His service on the Court included writing the opinion in the case of\" Commonwealth v. Drum\", which is often cited as the foundation authority on the legal definition of murder in Pennsylvania. At the conclusion of his term in 1879, Agnew retired to his home in Beaver and from that point handled only a very few select legal matters. He occupied his time by writing a number of pamphlets devoted to the history of the Beaver area. His health began to decline around 1899 and he died on March 9, 1902. He was survived by two sons and two daughters. He was predeceased by his wife and possibly a daughter. Agnew was in the Whig Party until the Republican Party was being organized in the late 1850s. He assisted in that party's organization and was thereafter known as a Republican. He attended the Methodist Episcopal church. He received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Washington College( 1864) and Dickinson College( 1880), both in Pennsylvania.

Abd\u00f3n Cifuentes Espinoza, GCSG (16 May 1835 - 14 April 1928) was one of Chile's most significant Catholic politicians in the nineteenth century. He was the son of Jos\u00e9 Maria Cifuentes Olivares and Paula Espinoza Pinto born in San Felipe, Chile. He married Luz G\u00f3mez, with whom he fathered 13 children. Cifuentes attended the \"Instituto Nacional\" (National Institute) and then studied law at the \"Universidad de Chile\" (University of Chile), receiving his law degree in 1861. Cifuentes went on to become a professor at the \"Colegio San Luis\" and then the \"Instituto Nacional\". In 1882, he was named a member of the Faculty of Philosophy & Humanities of the \"Universidad de Chile\", and in 1889 he became professor of constitutional rights at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Because of the perceived need for Catholic elements to combat liberals in the press, Cifuentes made contributions to various Chilean periodicals. Together with his former student and fellow Catholic intellectual Zorobabel Rodr\u00edguez, Cifuentes founded the daily newspaper \"El IndependienteThe Independent\") in 1864. In 1867, Cifuentes helped form the \"Sociedad de Amigos del Pa\u00eds\" (Society of Friends of the Country) and in 1883 he was one of the founders of the \"Uni\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica de Chile\" (Catholic Union of Chile).

After the deaths of his father and his guru, in 1918 Bimla Prasad accepted the Hindu formal order of asceticism(\" sannyasa\"), becoming known as Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami. In the same year Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati inaugurated in Calcutta the first center of his institution, later known as the Gaudiya Math. It soon developed into a dynamic missionary and educational institution with sixty- four branches across India and three centres abroad( in Burma, Germany, and England). The Math propagated the teachings of Gaudiya Vaishnavism by means of daily, weekly, and monthly periodicals, books of the Vaishnava canon, and public programs as well as through such innovations as\" theistic exhibitions\" with dioramas. Known for his intense and outspoken oratory and writing style as the acharya-keshari(\" lion guru\"). Bhaktisiddhanta opposed the monistic interpretation of Hinduism, or\" advaita\", that had emerged as the prevalent strand of Hindu thought in India, seeking to establish traditional personalist\" krishna- bhakti\" as its fulfillment and higher synthesis. At the same time, through lecturing and writing, Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati( Prabhupad) targeted both the ritualistic casteism of smarta brahmanas and sensualised practices of numerous Gaudiya Vaishnavism spin- offs, branding them as\" apasampradayas\" \u2013 deviations from the original Gaudiya Vaishnavism taught in the 16th century by Caitanya Mahaprabhu and his close successors. The mission initiated by Bhaktivinoda and developed by Bhaktisiddhanta emerged as\" the most powerful reformist movement\" of Vaishnavism in Bengal of the 19th and early 20th century.

While he was the only Kersauson not to have been born in Brittany, he was born on 20 July 1944 and brought up near Morlaix in a \u201c provincial Catholic aristocracy with compulsory mass \u201d as he calls it. Very early on, Olivier de Kersauson was to break away from his family. Without being inattentive, he was a pupil who did not settle in well to school life with the priests at boarding school. He passed through eleven schools altogether. After his final school exams and getting up to a lot of things, always on the coast, he began studying economics. At the age of twenty- two, he met Eric Tabarly in Saint Malo. Shortly after, Eric invited him to do his military service on board. This opportunity stretched into eight years during which he was Tabarly \u2019s mate. In 1973- 74, he was a crewmember on the yacht Pen Duick VI in the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race.

Together they put a considerable effort to modernize Bulgarian literature through contemporary philosophic, ethic and aesthetic ideas and are cited as the originators of modernism in the country; they are also associated with philosophical individualism. Petko Todorov was born in a prominent Bulgarian National Revival family( a relative of Stoyan Mihaylovski, the nephew of religious leader Stoyan Mihaylovski, better known as Ilarion Makariopolski). Initially influenced by the ideas of socialism, lately he revised his understandings. He studied law in Bern and literature in Leipzig, travelled through France, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, Italy, Poland, Czeckoslovakia and Ukraine, and focused on his literary career after the first years of the 20th century. Among his preferred authors were Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov and Gustave Flaubert among others. An important influence was Henrik Ibsen and through Todorov he exercised a strong impact on contemporary Bulgarian drama. While Slaveykov and Yavorov were most famous as poets, Todorov turned into the\" par excellence\" representative of modernist prose and drama in the country. Todorov interweaved the fantastic with the realistic, placing an emphasis on folklore poetic, and is best known for his stylistically brilliance in the short stories \u2018 Idilii\u2019(\" Idylls\", 1908) and his dramas \u2018 Zidari \u2019(\" The Builders\" also known as\" Masons\", 1902) and \u2018 Zmeyova svatba\u2019(\" Zmei \u2019s Wedding\", 1910).

Petko Todorov was born in a prominent Bulgarian National Revival family( a relative of Stoyan Mihaylovski, the nephew of religious leader Stoyan Mihaylovski, better known as Ilarion Makariopolski). Initially influenced by the ideas of socialism, lately he revised his understandings. He studied law in Bern and literature in Leipzig, travelled through France, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, Italy, Poland, Czeckoslovakia and Ukraine, and focused on his literary career after the first years of the 20th century. Among his preferred authors were Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov and Gustave Flaubert among others. An important influence was Henrik Ibsen and through Todorov he exercised a strong impact on contemporary Bulgarian drama. While Slaveykov and Yavorov were most famous as poets, Todorov turned into the\" par excellence\" representative of modernist prose and drama in the country. Todorov interweaved the fantastic with the realistic, placing an emphasis on folklore poetic, and is best known for his stylistically brilliance in the short stories \u2018 Idilii\u2019(\" Idylls\", 1908) and his dramas \u2018 Zidari \u2019(\" The Builders\" also known as\" Masons\", 1902) and \u2018 Zmeyova svatba\u2019(\" Zmei \u2019s Wedding\", 1910).

John Benson Brooks( February 23, 1917, Houlton, Maine \u2013 November 13, 1999, New York City) was an American jazz pianist, songwriter, arranger, and composer. Brooks worked early in his career as an arranger for Randy Brooks, Les Brown, Boyd Raeburn, and Tommy Dorsey. He worked often with lyricists Eddie DeLange and Bob Russell in the 1940s; he and DeLange wrote the song\" Just as Though You Were Here,\" a hit for Tommy Dorsey with Frank Sinatra as vocalist. He wrote\" You Came a Long Way from St. Louis\" with Bob Russell for Ray McKinley, released as a single in 1948. In 1956 Brooks worked with Zoot Sims and Al Cohn on a recording\" Folk Jazz U.S.A.\" He became better- known as a composer during this time, and his works blend elements of folk music and dodecaphony with the idioms of modern jazz. In 1958 he composed a work entitled\" Alabama Concerto\" and assembled a cast of sidemen for a recording which included Cannonball Adderley, Art Farmer, Barry Galbraith, and Milt Hinton. The recording was eventually re-issued under Adderley's name. Brooks was a close friend of Gil Evans. Evans later recorded his works\" Sirhan's Blues\" and\" Where Flamingos Fly\"( the last co-written with Harold Courlander and Elthea Peale). Brooks and Courlander collaborated on a book of transcriptions of rural blues and spirituals in Alabama, which provided some of the inspiration for the\" Alabama Concerto\".

The film stars Jeanne Crain, Edmund Purdom, and Vincent Price. Purdom had previously starred in\" The Egyptian\"( 1954), which has a similar plot and characters. In Thebes, Benakon reveals to Tenet that he is her father. He also tells her that she is not to be a priestess; the old pharaoh had agreed that she should marry Amenophis on his death. He gives her the new name Nefertiti and says she is to be the Queen of the Nile. Amenophis accepts her as his wife, unaware that Nefertiti is the same person as the\" Tenet\" he had given to Tumos. Tumos, an obstacle in the whole plan, has been arrested by Benakon. He eventually escapes from prison, but is attacked and mauled by a lion. He survives and is nursed by Merith( Liana Orfei), an artist's model who is in love with him. Nefertiti is told he is dead. Tumos soon learns that Tenet is now called Nefertiti and is married to the pharaoh. He gets drunk and sleeps with Merith. When Nefertiti learns that Tumos is alive, she asks Amenophis to make him the court sculptor and order him to sculpt a bust of Nefertiti. While he works on it, the couple renew their love. Meanwhile Benakon is disturbed by the growing influence of Seper's god. His men burst into the Atenist church, killing Seper and many of the worshipers. Nefertiti is among them, but escapes with Tumos' help. Amenophis is disgusted by the killing. He proclaims that all idols are to be destroyed and the old priesthood abolished. However, he forgives Benakon, to emphasise his devotion to the values of the new faith. Benakon and his followers plan a rising against the new religion, but Nefertiti learns of their plans. Tumos leaves to collect an army to defend the city. Benakon's followers surround the royal palace, and paralysed by his new pacifist ideals, Amenophis has a mental breakdown. Nefertiti assumes command of the defence of the palace while waiting for Tumos to bring reinforcements. Horrified by the violence the religious conflict has unleashed, Amenophis kills himself. Nefertiti and her guards make a last stand around the sculpture of the queen, but are overwhelmed. Tumos and Merith arrive just in time with the army, but Benakon nearly stabs Tumos before Merith kills him with an arrow shot. The army restore Nefertiti to the throne. The famous bust of Nefertiti survives the centuries to prove the queen's magnificent beauty and Tumos' love for her.

In Thebes, Benakon reveals to Tenet that he is her father. He also tells her that she is not to be a priestess; the old pharaoh had agreed that she should marry Amenophis on his death. He gives her the new name Nefertiti and says she is to be the Queen of the Nile. Amenophis accepts her as his wife, unaware that Nefertiti is the same person as the\" Tenet\" he had given to Tumos. Tumos, an obstacle in the whole plan, has been arrested by Benakon. He eventually escapes from prison, but is attacked and mauled by a lion. He survives and is nursed by Merith( Liana Orfei), an artist's model who is in love with him. Nefertiti is told he is dead. Tumos soon learns that Tenet is now called Nefertiti and is married to the pharaoh. He gets drunk and sleeps with Merith. When Nefertiti learns that Tumos is alive, she asks Amenophis to make him the court sculptor and order him to sculpt a bust of Nefertiti. While he works on it, the couple renew their love. Meanwhile Benakon is disturbed by the growing influence of Seper's god. His men burst into the Atenist church, killing Seper and many of the worshipers. Nefertiti is among them, but escapes with Tumos' help. Amenophis is disgusted by the killing. He proclaims that all idols are to be destroyed and the old priesthood abolished. However, he forgives Benakon, to emphasise his devotion to the values of the new faith. Benakon and his followers plan a rising against the new religion, but Nefertiti learns of their plans. Tumos leaves to collect an army to defend the city. Benakon's followers surround the royal palace, and paralysed by his new pacifist ideals, Amenophis has a mental breakdown. Nefertiti assumes command of the defence of the palace while waiting for Tumos to bring reinforcements. Horrified by the violence the religious conflict has unleashed, Amenophis kills himself. Nefertiti and her guards make a last stand around the sculpture of the queen, but are overwhelmed. Tumos and Merith arrive just in time with the army, but Benakon nearly stabs Tumos before Merith kills him with an arrow shot. The army restore Nefertiti to the throne. The famous bust of Nefertiti survives the centuries to prove the queen's magnificent beauty and Tumos' love for her. Two Fists, One Heart is a 2008 Australian drama film directed by Shawn Seet and written by Rai Fazio, and is based on Fazio's own life growing up. The film is set and was shot in Perth, Western Australia.

He was also a one- time rector of Verona's Jesuit College. In 1848 he was made president of the Jesuit College at Vienna now the University of Vienna. After immigrating to the United States, he was a professor of divinity at St. John's College in Fordham, New York. Later he taught philosophy at Georgetown College in the United States. On March 11, 1857, Cicaterri was appointed Santa Clara University's third president and inherited the financial woes created by construction projects. Cicaterri was removed from the University's presidency in 1861 due to Rome's displeasure. In January 1873, he was sent to the College of the Sacred Heart in Woodstock, Maryland, where he died July 15, 1873. Rajiv Gandhi( 20 August 1944 \u2013 21 May 1991) was an Indian politician who served as the 6th Prime Minister of India from 1984 to 1989. He took office after the 1984 assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, to become the youngest Indian Prime Minister at the age of 40. Gandhi was a scion of the politically powerful Nehru \u2013 Gandhi family, which had been associated with the Indian National Congress party. For much of his childhood, his maternal grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister. Gandhi attended college in the United Kingdom. He returned to India in 1966 and became a professional pilot for the state- owned Indian Airlines. In 1968, he married Sonia Gandhi; the couple settled in Delhi to a domestic life with their children Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. For much of the 1970s, his mother Indira Gandhi was prime minister and his brother Sanjay Gandhi an MP; despite this, Rajiv Gandhi remained apolitical. After Sanjay's death in a fighter plane crash in 1980, Gandhi reluctantly entered politics at the behest of Indira. The following year he won his brother's Parliamentary seat of Amethi and became a member of the Lok Sabha\u2014the lower house of India's Parliament. As part of his political grooming, Rajiv was made general secretary of the Congress party and given significant responsibility in organising the 1982 Asian Games. On the morning of 31 October 1984, his mother was assassinated by one of her bodyguards; later that day, Gandhi was appointed Prime Minister. His leadership was tested over the next few days as organised mobs rioted against the Sikh community, resulting in anti-Sikh riots in Delhi. That December, Congress party won the largest Lok Sabha majority to date, 411 seats out of 542. Rajiv Gandhi's period in office was mired in controversies; perhaps the greatest crises were the Bhopal disaster, Bofors scandal and the Shah Bano case. In 1988, he reversed the coup in Maldives, antagonising militant Tamil groups such as PLOTE, intervening and then sending peacekeeping troops to Sri Lanka in 1987, leading to open conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam( LTTE). In mid-1987, the Bofors scandal damaged his corruption- free image and resulted in a major defeat for his party in the 1989 election. Gandhi remained Congress President until the elections in 1991. While campaigning for the elections, he was assassinated by a suicide bomber from the LTTE. His widow Sonia became the president of the Congress party in 1998 and led the party to victory in the 2004 and 2009 parliamentary elections.
